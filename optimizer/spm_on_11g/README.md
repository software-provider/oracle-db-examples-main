<h2>SQL Plan Management Examples</h2>

Some scripts on the subject of SQL Plan Management in Oracle 11gR2. 

Spooled output in "lst" shows how the scripts can be used. 

View in order: 
* introduction.lst 
* evolve.lst
* sts.lst

<h3>introduction.lst</h3>

The basics of SQL plan management.

* Create SALES table
* Fill with data - the data is skewed
* Create index
* Gather stats
* Drop all SQL plan baselines to reset test
* Check cursor cache for queries LIKE "%sales%"
* Confirm there are no SQL plan baselines
* Execute a SALES query with a bind variable
* Check the query plan (it's a FULL table scan)
* Run SALES query again with a different bind variable value
* Check the plan - it's an INDEX RANGE SCAN because the data is skewed so use of an index is more efficient
* Run the query again, showing the other bind variable value results in a FULL scan.
* Repeat query, with different bind variable value resulting in INDEX RANGE SCAN
* Look in cursor cache - the query has multiple plans
* Use DISPLAY_CURSOR to see the different plans in the cursor cache
* Load all the plans from the cursor cache to create SQL plan baselines
* Check to see that the SQL plan baselines have been loaded
* Run the query with different bind variable values and confirm that both FULL and INDEX plans are used and the SQL plan baselines are used.
* Display the plan in a SQL plan baseline.

<h3>evolve.lst</h3>

Demonstrating evolution.

* Flush the shared pool to ensure that queries will be hard parsed
* Drop all baselines
* Run query with a bind variable value yielding a FULL scan (id=-1).
* Load the plan from the cursor cache to create a SQL plan baseline.
* Query DBA_SQL_PLAN_BASELINES to see the new plan baseline.
* Run the SALES query with a different bind variable value (id=1) - and because the data is skewed, it would be better if an index plan is used.
* However, note that the plan is still a FULL scan. This is because the SQL plan baseline is now being used and the only accepted plan is the FULL scan. The SQL plan baseline will prevent a new plan being used until it is accepted.
* Query DBA_SQL_PLAN_BASELINES and you can see that there is now an ACCEPTED=NO plan in the SQL plan history - in other words the INDEX plan has been seen but has not yet been accepted
* Run the SALES queries again
* EVOLVE SQL plan baselines using DBMS_SPM.EVOLVE_SQL_PLAN_BASELINE
* The new INDEX plan is accepted automatically
* Run the SALES query (with id=1) and it will now use the INDEX plan
* Run the SALES query (with id=-1) and it will now use the FULL plan

<h3>sts.sql</h3>

This example shows how you might use SQL plan management to capture ALL plans for a given workload. It means that you will capture and immediate enable all plans - so if there's data skew you won't need to be concerned that some important plans are not enabled. The idea here is that you capture the worload in a SQL tuning set, then you use this as the source of accepted SQL plan baselines.

* Flush the shared pool and drop SQL plan baselines
* Run a bunch of queries with different bind variable values and notice that one of the queries has a FULL plan and an INDEX plan (just as it did in evolve.lst)
* Look in the cursor cache
* Create a SQL tuning set from the cursor cache - note it assume that you are using a user called "ADHOC"
* Check the contents of the SQL tuning set
* Create SQL plan baselines from the SQL tuning set
* List the SQL plan baselines
* Run the SALES queries with different bind variable values and notice that the SQL plan baselines are used and the correct FULL or INDEX plan is immediately used where appropriate.
