<h2>SQL Plan Management Examples</h2>

Some scripts for trying out SQL Plan Management with Oracle Database In-Memory.

Tested on Oracle Database 12c, version 12.1.0.2.

They are intended to supplement parts 1 to 3 of a <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/optimizer/entry/tips_on_sql_plan_management">series of blog posts on SPM and Oracle Database In-Memory.</a>.

Example "lst" files are provided so that you can see the expected output. Beware that "drop_base.sql" will drop ALL EXISTING SQL Plan Baselines. Use test instances only.

DISCLAIMER:
   <br/>-- These scripts are provided for educational purposes only.
   <br/>-- They are NOT supported by Oracle World Wide Technical Support.
   <br/>-- The scripts have been tested and they appear to work as intended
   <br/>-- You should always run scripts on a test instance.
