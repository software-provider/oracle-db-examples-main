This is a top level repository for code examples related to the Oracle Optimizer and, occasionally, Data Warehousing and Very Large Databases.  

The examples are generally self-contained, each wthin a directory containing all the scripts you'll need to complete a particular example. The scripts can be executed using SQL Plus or <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html">Oracle SQL Developer.</a>

Many of the scripts are referenced from the Oracle Optimizer Blog, here: https://blogs.oracle.com/optimizer
