<h2>Data Loading Examples</h2>

Some examples of loading data into an Oracle database, and note that the Java code includes examples of both good and (very!) bad practice. For full details, and the background behind the examples, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr2DC-1W0i8&feature=youtu.be">Youtube web seminar</a>. It explains how you can use good practice to ensure a smooth path forward if your solution needs to scale out and accomodate large data volumes and high load rates.

The Java was tested on JDK 7 and Oracle Database 12.1.0.2, but it will work without issue on Oracle 11gR2 too. To compile it, your project will need to include the Oracle JDBC client libraries.

The Python example requires <a href="http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/">cx_Oracle</a>, which in turn depends an Oracle client installation (for example, the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index.html">basic instant client plus the SDK).</a>

The example_output.txt file is included so that you can see how the Java code behaves. Note that it shows what happens if you use a transatlantic SQLNet connection: any optimization that reduces the number of network rountrips results in a very significant performance improvment - above all others! If you are using a local database, you will want to increase *rowCount* significantly.

A SQL script is included to create the test table. Your Oracle user will need to have database resource/create table permissions to create it. Also, make sure that you can "select \* from" v$mystat and v$statname using your Oracle user account (a DBA account holder can grant your user access to these data dictionary views if necessary).
